*A curated list of quantum-accelerated kernels.*

### 101

**What are quantum kernels?**

*Like their classical counterparts, quantum kernels are similarity measures between pairs of data samples encoded in a high-dimensional feature space. The distinction is that quantum kernels use quantum circuits as feature maps. This allows for the exploitation of an exponentially large quantum state space during kernel matrix calculation without having to store the exponentially large vector representations of that space in computer memory.*

**Are quantum kernels better than normal kernels?**

*Not necessarily. We know that a quantum advantage can only be obtained if the quantum kernel circuit is hard to estimate classically [2]. In general, finding a good quantum kernel for a given dataset can be challenging.*

**How do I choose a quantum kernel?**

*Designing a quantum kernel is a process that strongly depends on the learning problem at hand. In general, we cannot suggest an optimal feature mapping with no prior knowledge of the learning problem.*

*Sometimes structure in the data can inform the selection of a kernel [1], [3]; whereas other times kernels may be chosen in an ad hoc manner. Another option is to train a parametrized quantum kernel on a labeled dataset using Qiskit.*

*As quoted by Qiskit. Here you can find the [article.](https://medium.com/qiskit/training-quantum-kernels-for-machine-learning-using-qiskit-617f6e4ed9ac)*

### Kernels In Quantum Context

In computing, a compute kernel is a routine compiled for high throughput accelerators. Compute kernels roughly correspond to inner loops when implementing algorithms in traditional languages (except there is no implied sequential operation), or to code passed to internal iterators. Software layers or APIs allows software to use certain types of devices for general purpose processing operations. This accessibility makes it easier for specialists in programming to use devices which can be GPUs or QPUs. Gives direct access to compute devices' virtual instruction set and computational elements, for the execution of compute kernels.

### Why Does This Repository Stands For?

This repository is a collection of kernels for both mathematical and software libraries for compute functionality.
Also contains fundamental resources to dive into this area.
